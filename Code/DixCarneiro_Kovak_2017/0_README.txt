Given confidentiality agreements with the Brazilian Ministry of Labor, we cannot
make available the micro-data from RAIS. 

Our replication files make available all of the do files we have used to process
the micro-data and generate data at the regional level, which are then used in 
our empirical specifications. All of the log-files of these codes are made 
available in these replication files. See codes for details. All of the 
regional-level data are available in these replication files, so that users are 
able to run all of the final empirical specifications using regional-level data.

Access to RAIS data from 1992 to 2010 was granted to us by the Brazilian Ministry
We reached Rosangela Farias at rosangela.farias@mte.gov.br and
cget.sppe@mte.gov.br

Access to RAIS data from 1986 to 1991 was granted to us by Joao De Negri from
the Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada. He can be reached at /Users/jfogel/Opportunity Insights Dropbox/Jamie Fogel/Networks/Data/ReplicationFiles_DIXCARNEIRO-KOVAK

To replicate our empirical findings, perform the following steps:

- Edit the first lines of 1_Run_Census_Other.do and 2_Run_RAIS_Analysis.do to
  point to the location of the ReplicationFiles/ folder in your file system
- Run 1_Run_Census_Other.do
- Run 2_Run RAIS_Analysis.do

Results are saved in the Results/ folder

Description of Directories and Files

- Codes_Census/
Do files to perform analyses using primarily Census data.  See the header in
each do file for descriptions.

- Codes_Other/
Do files to perform analyses using primarily Other data sources (neither Census
nor RAIS).  See the header in each do file for descriptions.

- Codes_RAIS_Manipulation/
Do files processing individual-level RAIS data to generate region-level
information, saved in ProcessedData_RAIS/.  As mentioned above, because we 
cannot post individual-level RAIS data, these do files are not executed in 
the replication code, but are provided for those who gain access to RAIS.  
See Codes_RAIS_Manipulation/0_README.txt for descriptions of the do files in this
folder.

- Codes_RAIS_Regressions/
Generates results using the region-level RAIS data in ProcessedData_RAIS/.  See 
the header in each do file for descriptions.

- Data/
Contains intermediate data files generated by other do files.

- Data_Census/
Contains raw Census data, auxiliary data files, and do files used to go from 
the raw Census data to our main Census sample with variables coded for 
analysis. See the header in each do file for descriptions.

- Data_Other/
Contains data files from other sources.  See Data_Other/
Data_Other_Descriptions.txt for descriptions of each file.

- ProcessedData_RAIS/
Contains region-level RAIS data used in the analysis.

- Results
Replication results for the main text and primary robustness tests.
